# Prerequisites

The following steps should be completed before getting started with any of the labs in this repository. Not all steps may apply to all students or environments.

This lab contains the following tasks:

1. Signing in to the AWS Management Console
2. Creating a lab environment using AWS CloudFormation
3. Verify lab environment


## 1. Signing in to the AWS Management Console

If you are running these labs in a formal, instructional setting, please use the Console URL, and credentials provided to you to access and log into the AWS Management Console. Otherwise, please use your own credentials. You can access the console at: <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">https://console.aws.amazon.com/</a> or through the Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism provided by your organization.

If you are running these labs in a formal, instructional setting, **please use the AWS region provided**. Ensure the correct AWS region is selected in the top right corner, if not use that dropdown to choose the correct region. The labs are designed to work in any of the regions where Amazon Aurora MySQL compatible is available. However, not all features and capabilities of Amazon Aurora may be available in all supported regions at this time.

## 2. Creating a lab environment using AWS CloudFormation

To simplify the getting started experience with the labs, we have created foundational templates for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">AWS CloudFormation</a> that provision the resources needed for the lab environment. These templates are designed to deploy a consistent networking infrastructure, and client-side experience of software packages and components used in the lab.

!!! warning "Formal Event"
    If you are running these labs in a formal instructional event, the lab environment may have been initialized on your behalf. If unsure, please verify with the event support staff.

Please choose the most appropriate CloudFormation template based on the labs you want to run, and click **Launch Stack**:

Option | One-Click Launch
--- | ---
**I will create the DB cluster manually** | <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?stackName=labstack&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/[[bucket]]/templates/lab_template.yml&param_deployCluster=No" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png" alt="Launch Stack"></a>
**Create an Aurora Provisioned DB cluster for me automatically** | <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?stackName=labstack&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/[[bucket]]/templates/lab_template.yml&param_deployCluster=Yes" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png" alt="Launch Stack"></a>

??? tip "Can I see the CloudFormation template?"
    Yes, we encourage you to download the CloudFormation template, review the resources that are being created and how they are configured.

    [Download the CloudFormation template](https://[[website]]/templates/lab_template.yml)

!!! warning "Region Check"
    Ensure you are still working in the correct region, especially if you are following the links above to open the service console at the right screen.

In the field named **Stack Name**, ensure the value `labstack` is preset. For the **Use AZs** parameter (Regional Settings section) select 3 availability zones (AZs) from the dropdown. If your desired region only supports 2 AZs, please select just the two AZs available.

If you are planning to run the Aurora Machine Learning integration labs, please also select **Yes** for the **Enable Aurora ML Labs?** parameter (Lab Features section).

<span class="image">![Create Stack](2-create-stack-params.png?raw=true)</span>

Scroll to the bottom of the page, check the box that reads: **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names** and then click **Create stack**.

<span class="image">![Create Stack](2-create-stack-confirm.png?raw=true)</span>

The stack will take approximatively 20 minutes to provision, you can monitor the status on the **Stack detail** page. You can monitor the progress of the stack creation process by refreshing the **Events** tab. The latest event in the list will indicate `CREATE_COMPLETE` for the stack resource.

<span class="image">![Stack Status](2-stack-status.png?raw=true)</span>

Once the status of the stack is `CREATE_COMPLETE`, click on the **Outputs** tab. The values here will be critical to the completion of the remainder of the lab.  Please take a moment to save these values somewhere that you will have easy access to them during the remainder of the lab. The names that appear in the **Key** column are referenced directly in the instructions in subsequent steps, using the parameter format: ==[outputKey]==

## 3. Verify lab environment

Let's make sure your workstation has been configured properly:

* Do you see a value similar to `i-0123456789abcdef0` (the value may vary) for the **bastionInstance** CloudFormation stack output key?

If so, you may proceed to the next lab. Otherwise please revisit the instructions above, you might have missed a step.
