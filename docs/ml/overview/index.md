# Machine Learning with Amazon Aurora

Machine learning integration with Amazon Aurora currently supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/" target="_blank">Amazon Comprehend</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" target="_blank">Amazon SageMaker</a>. Aurora makes direct and secure calls to SageMaker and Comprehend that don’t go through the application layer. Aurora machine learning is based on the familiar SQL programming language, so you don’t need to build custom integrations, move data around, learn separate tools, or have prior machine learning experience.

This lab contains the following tasks:

1. Setup a sample schema and data for ML labs

This lab requires the following prerequisites:

* [Deploy Environment](/prereqs/environment/) - choose **Yes** for the **Enable Aurora ML Labs?** feature option
* [Connect to the Session Manager Workstation](/prereqs/connect/)

## 1. Setup a sample schema and data for ML labs

If you are not already connected to the Session Manager workstation command line, please connect [following these instructions](/prereqs/connect/). Once connected, run the command below, replacing the ==[clusterEndpoint]== placeholder with the cluster endpoint of your DB cluster. This will connect you to the Aurora Mysql database.

```shell
mysql -h[clusterEndpoint] -u$DBUSER -p"$DBPASS"
```

Execute the following SQL queries to create the `mltest` database and tables, and populate them with data. We will use these tables in subsequent labs for inferences.

```sql
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS `mltest`;
CREATE SCHEMA `mltest`;
USE `mltest`;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `comments`;
CREATE TABLE `comments` (
 `comment_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
 `comment_text` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

INSERT INTO `comments` (comment_text) VALUES
("This is very useful, thank you for writing it!"),
("Awesome, I was waiting for this feature."),
("An interesting write up, please add more details."),
("I don’t like how this was implemented."),
("Horrible writing, I have read better books.");

CREATE TABLE `churn` (
 `state` varchar(2048) DEFAULT NULL,
 `acc_length` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
 `area_code` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
 `int_plan` varchar(2048) DEFAULT NULL,
 `vmail_plan` varchar(2048) DEFAULT NULL,
 `vmail_msg` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
 `day_mins` double DEFAULT NULL,
 `day_calls` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
 `eve_mins` double DEFAULT NULL,
 `eve_calls` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
 `night_mins` double DEFAULT NULL,
 `night_calls` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
 `int_mins` double DEFAULT NULL,
 `int_calls` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
 `cust_service_calls` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
 `Churn` varchar(2048) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

LOAD DATA FROM S3 's3-us-east-1://awsauroralabsmy-us-east-1/samples/mldata/churn.txt'
INTO TABLE `churn`
COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(state,acc_length,area_code,@dummy1,int_plan,vmail_plan,vmail_msg,day_mins,day_calls,@dummy2,eve_mins,eve_calls,@dummy3,night_mins,night_calls,@dummy4,int_mins,int_calls,@dummy5,cust_service_calls,Churn);
```

Verify that the schema was created correctly by running the following command:

```sql
show tables;
```

You should be able to see two tables, **churn** and **comments**, as shown below. If you don't see the tables rerun the commands.

Disconnect from the DB cluster, using:

```sql
quit;
```

You may now proceed to the next labs and integrate Aurora with machine learning services.
