# Aurora MySQL SQL Performance Troubleshooting - Observability (WIP)

In this lab, we are going to demonstrate *how to troubleshoot SQL performance related issues using* different tools. Specifically we are going to look at how you can leverage *CW metrics, EM metrics, P.I, slow query logs, CloudWatch logs and CloudWatch log insights, pt-query-digest* to identify bottlenecks. Also we are going to briefly shows how indexes can help in improving the performance of your query.

This lab contains the following tasks:

* *Setup* the environment to capture slow queries
* *Monitor* using *CW* Metrics and Enhanced Monitoring(*EM*)
* *Identify top* queries using performance insights(*P.I*)
* *View* slow queries using  various options like *RDS console, CloudWatch logs, CloudWatch log insights, pt-query digest*
* *Analyse* the slow queries using MySQL *Explain* plan, *profiling*
* *Tune* the Queries
* *Performance Review*

*Optional:* Performance schema

This lab requires the following prerequisites:

* [Get Started](/prereqs/environment/)
* [Connect to the Session Manager Workstation](/prereqs/connect/)
* [Create a New DB Cluster](/provisioned/create/) (conditional, only if you plan to create a cluster manually)
* [Connect, Load Data](/provisioned/interact/) (You can ignore **Auto Scale** section for this lab)


## 1. Preparation of lab

### Connect to the DB cluster

Connect to the Aurora database just like you would to any other MySQL-based database, using a compatible client tool. In this lab you will be using the mysql command line tool to connect.If you are not already connected to the Session Manager workstation command line from previous labs, please connect following these [instructions](https://awsauroralabsmy.com/prereqs/connect/). Once connected, run the command below, replacing the [clusterEndpoint] placeholder with the cluster endpoint of your DB cluster.

```shell
mysql -h[clusterEndpoint] -u$DBUSER -p"$DBPASS" mylab
```
Once connected to the database, please use the code below to create the schema and stored procedure we'll use later in the lab, to generate load on the DB cluster. Run the following SQL queries:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `weather`;
CREATE TABLE `weather` (
  `date_Str` date NOT NULL COMMENT 'Date and Time of Readings',
  degres_from_mean varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  id varchar(11) NOT NULL COMMENT 'station id',
  longitude decimal(20,4) NOT NULL COMMENT 'longitude',
  latitude decimal(20,4) NOT NULL COMMENT 'latitude',
  max_temp decimal(20,2) NOT NULL COMMENT 'max temp logged',
  min_temp decimal(20,2) NOT NULL COMMENT 'min temp logged',
  station_name char(50) NOT NULL COMMENT 'station names',
  type char(25) NOT NULL COMMENT 'weather condition',
  serialid int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT 'serial id of log'
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ;
```

```sql
DELIMITER $$
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS insert_temp;
CREATE PROCEDURE insert_temp()
BEGIN
DECLARE key_value,key_value1,key_value2 int;
set key_value =FLOOR(3196831 + RAND() * 3200000);
INSERT INTO mylab.weather VALUES (1993-12-10,14.38,'USC00147271',-100.92,38.47,21.70,-4.40,'SCOTT CITY','Weak Hot',key_value);
DELETE from mylab.weather  where serialid=key_value;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

### Load an initial data set from S3

Next, load an initial data set by importing data from an Amazon S3 bucket(fix the bucket):

```sql
LOAD DATA FROM S3 's3-eu-west-1://auroralab-data-4cc625f0/weather-anomalies.csv'
INTO TABLE weather CHARACTER SET 'latin1' fields terminated by ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '\"' ignore 1 lines;
```

Data loading may take several minutes, you will receive a successful query message once it completes.

### Verify the parameters of slow query logs

In many cases the slow query log can be used to find queries that take a long time to execute and are therefore candidates for optimization. Slow query logs are controlled by various parameters and the most notable ones are **[slow_query_log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_slow_query_log), [long_query_time](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_long_query_time) and [log_output](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_log_output)** .

Please run the query below and output should look like

```shell
$ mysql -h [cluster endpoint]-u$DBUSER -p"$DBPASS" -e"select @@slow_query_log,@@long_query_time,@@log_output;"
```

<span class="image">![long query output](long_query_out.png?raw=true)</span>

??? tip  " In production systems, you can change the values for **long_query_time** in multiple iterations eg. 10 to 5 and then 5 to 3 and so on".  

Before proceeding further, please ensure the output looks like above.When completed, exit the MySQL command line:

```shell
quit;
```
*Optional:* There are other parameters and you can read about **[log_queries_not_using_indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_log_queries_not_using_indexes), [log_slow_admin_statements](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_log_slow_admin_statements)**.

### Run the workload

On the [session manager terminal](https://awsauroralabsmy.com/prereqs/connect/), please run the following to generate workload.

```shell
python3 weather_perf.py -e[clusterendpoint] -u$DBUSER -p"$DBPASS" -dmylab
```
This script will take about **4~5** minutes to complete.

## 2. Monitor DB performance states using *CloudWatch* Metrics, Enhanced Monitoring(*EM*) and Performance Insights(P.I)

### CloudWatch Metrics

You can monitor DB instances using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Amazon RDS into readable, near real-time metrics. Open the [Amazon RDS service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home) and click on [Databases](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home#databases:) from left navigation pane. From list of databases click on auroralab-mysql-node-1 under *DB identifier*. On the database details view, click on the *Monitoring* tab and pick cloudwatch metrics from Monitoring.

Although all the metrics are important to monitor, we can see that the base metrics like *CPU, DB connections, write latency,* *Read latency* etc are spiking up during this workload. You can click on a chart to drill down for more details, select any chart area to zoom in on a specific time period to understand the overall workload and its impact on the DB.

  <span class="image">![CW Metrics](db-cpu.png?raw=true)</span> <span class="image">![CW Metrics](latency.png?raw=true)</span>

Amazon Aurora also provides a range of dedicated [CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.html) populated with various database status variables. Let’s take a look at *DML metrics (*using the search bar*)* for this period and see how to interpret it.

In general,

* Database activity variables responsible for tracking *throughput* are modified when the statement is received by the server.
* Database activity variables responsible for tracking *latency* are modified after the statement completes. This is quite intuitive: statement latency (i.e. execution time) is not known until the statement finishes.

<span class="image">![CW Metrics](DML_throughput.png?raw=true)</span> <span class="image">![CW Metrics](DML_latency.png?raw=true)</span>

*Note:*To learn more about how to plan for Aurora monitoring and Performance guidelines please refer our [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/MonitoringOverview.html).

DMLLatency metric reveals a spike at 22:57, when the metric reached 4442 milliseconds. In other words, 4.4 seconds is the average latency of all DML statements that finished during this 1-minute period. 4 seconds is significantly higher than the baseline latency observed before the spike, therefore it’s worth investigating.

A useful piece of information readily available from DMLThroughput metric . At 22.57 DML throughput is 0.907 which is roughly 54 operations. This could be the reason for the DML latency we noticed before.

```shell

.907 Operations
     ---------- X 60s= 54.42 ~ 54 operations
        s
```

**Optional:** Once the performance baseline is understood you can setup alarms against CW metrics when it exceeds the baseline for corrective actions.

### Enhanced Monitoring

You must have noticed that the CW metrics didn’t start populating right away as it takes 60 seconds interval period to capture data points. However to monitor and understand OS/host level metrics eg. if the CPU is consumed by user or system, free/active memory for as granular as 1 second interval, [Enhanced Monitoring(EM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.CloudWatchLogs.html) should help.

If you have Enhanced Monitoring option enabled for the database instance, you can view the metrics by selecting the **node(writer)** -> **Monitoring** -> select **Enhanced Monitoring** option from the Monitoring **dropdown** list. For more information about enabling and using the Enhanced Monitoring feature, please refer to the [Enhanced Monitoring doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html).


<span class="image">![EM](EM.png?raw=true)</span>

From the above, we could see when the workload kicked in, there is a sharp *spike* in CPU driven by *User* and *drop* in Free memory. We can also see the *Load average* of the DB instance increased during this period.

**Note:** You will see additional counters showing metrics captured at the guest OS level as well as local storage (not Aurora storage).

### Doing more with Performance Insights

#### Identify *top* SQL queries using performance insights dashboard.

Amazon RDS Performance Insights monitors your Amazon RDS DB instance load so that you can analyze and troubleshoot your database performance. To view the current performance insights dashboard, please go to the [RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) and in the navigation pane, click performance insights and choose the writer node. You should see the console like below.  

<span class="image">![Performance Insights](P.I_load.png?raw=true)</span>

The dashboard is divided into 3 sections(Counter Metrics, Database Load and Top SQL activity), allowing you to drill down from high level performance indicator metrics down to individual *queries*, *wait events*, *latency* etc. You can learn more about this in the [previous lab](https://awsauroralabsmy.com/provisioned/perf-insights/).

##### Adding additional counters:

Let’s start by adding counters in the *Counter Metrics* under Manage Metrics. This collects metrics from *DB* like innodb_rows_read, threads_running etc and *OS* metrics like cpuUtilization total, user etc which adds valuable information on top of CW metrics.

<span class="image">![Performance Insights](counter_manage.png?raw=true)</span>

Enable *slow_queries* under DB Metrics and *cpuUtilization*  *total* under OS metrics

<span class="image">![Performance Insights](P.I_counter_split.png?raw=true)</span>

Click Update graph and once done, the counter metrics should look like below. We could see the CPU spike of ~100% for the ~4 minute period and the number of rows read is *1+ million* and slow logs were getting logged for this duration.

<span class="image">![Performance Insights](counter_before_index.png?raw=true)</span>

##### Getting different perspective of DB Load:

Let's look at the DB wait events to understand the workload. We can see different wait events on the right hand side. Amazon Aurora MySQL specific *wait events* are documented in the [Amazon Aurora MySQL Reference guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Reference.html#AuroraMySQL.Reference.Waitevents)


<span class="image">![P.I](P.I_DB_Load_1.png?raw=true)</span>

We can also change the view of *DB Load section* from “Slice by wait“ to ”Slice by SQL“ to understand the AAS of different queries during this time. We could also see the the max number of available *vCPUs* is 2 but the current sessions exceeds the max vCPU and this in many cases would be driving factor for CPU/memory consumption.


<span class="image">![P.I](P.I_DB_Load_2.png?raw=true)</span>


##### Getting additional information from the session activity:

Now let’s modify the *Session activity* part. The default interface for Top SQL contains AAS and SQL statements should look like this. Please go to the preferences section(gear icon at the right hand bottom) and add additional columns components.

<span class="image">![SQL troubleshooting](session_manage.png?raw=true)</span>

To understand the performance profile it’s important to have additional information about the query access pattern. For the purpose of this lab, please enable Rows affected/sec,Rows affected/call,Rows examined/sec,Rows examined/call,Rows sent/sec,Rows sent/call and click *save*.

<span class="image">![P.I](P.I_expand_gear.png?raw=true)</span>


Once saved, the session activity for Top SQL would look like below. You should be able to see *rows examined/s* vs *rows sent/s* and corresponding *avg. latency* in ms/call. It would be ideal to focus on the queries with large difference between rows examined and rows sent .

<span class="image">![SQL troubleshooting](xx.png?raw=true)</span>

*Note:* To see the queries inside the stored procedure, please click and expand the + icon.

You can note down the top SQL queries but please keep in mind not all TOP SQL queries are slow queries it only means that these queries are consuming the load at given point of time.

As you noticed we can see performance insights are very good to understand average activity sessions however if you would like to get individual query stats/execution time then we should seek slow query logs.


## 3. View *slow* queries

### View and download slow query logs using the console

Lets’ view the slow query logs using the console . Since we ran the above script using the cluster endpoint(which points to the writer node by default), we should check the writer node logs. You can open the Amazon [RDS service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home#database:id=auroralab-mysql-cluster;is-cluster=true;tab=monitoring) and click the cluster and select the writer node. Once selected, under *Logs & Events* scroll down to the *Logs* section. You should see like below.

<span class="image">![SQL troubleshooting](P.I_expand.png?raw=true)</span>

You can select the slow query log for the timeframe and *view*/*watch* it and it should look like below if opted to *view*.
[Image: Screenshot 2021-05-21 at 19.05.49.png]

You should see slow queries in the console. The log file content will have the following

*Query_time*: The statement execution time in seconds.
*Lock_time*: The time to acquire locks in seconds.
*Rows_sent*: The number of rows sent to the client.
*Rows_examined*: The number of rows examined by the server layer (not counting any processing internal to storage engines).

To learn more about slow queries, please check the [official doc](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html). **

You can download the logs via *console* or *CLI* using [download-db-log-file-portion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/download-db-log-file-portion.html). For now, let’s call this log as *slow_query_log1*.

*Note:* Log gets rotated hourly so please ensure the logs are downloaded for the workload period.

### Leveraging CloudWatch logs and Log insights to view and analyze slow queries

Slow logs are great for troubleshooting but viewing/downloading individual logs could be time consuming. Also the logs could get rotated(if log_output= FILE) periodically. In addition to viewing and downloading DB instance logs from the console, you can *publish* logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs . With CloudWatch Logs, you can perform real-time analysis of the log data, store and retain the data in highly durable storage, and manage the data with the CloudWatch Logs Agent.

We have already *enabled* export Cloudwatch logs option when we created the cluster. This can be verified by going to the RDS console, under cluster *configuration→ Published logs* like below. Please proceed to next step only if you see slow query  in it.

<span class="image">![CWL](CWL1.png?raw=true)</span>

*Note:* To enable/disable these logs or add additional logs, you can click *Modify* at the *right top → Log exports → tick/untick prefered logs → continue → modify cluster.*

<span class="image">![CWL](CWL2.png?raw=true)</span>

You can also verify the status of CloudWatch export and the type of logs thats currently enabled for export by executing the *CLI* below on the session manager terminal.

```shell
aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier auroralab-mysql-cluster --query DBClusters[*].EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports
```
You should see the output like below. This sample output shows that currently export CloudWatch logs option is enabled for error logs and slow query logs.

<span class="image">![CWL](CWL3.png?raw=true)</span>

### View exported logs in CloudWatch

After enabling Aurora MySQL log events, you can monitor the events in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. A new log group is automatically created for the Aurora DB cluster under the following prefix, in which cluster-name represents the DB cluster name, and log_type represents the log type.

/aws/rds/cluster/cluster-name/log_type

For our DB cluster auroralab-mysql-cluster, slow query data is stored in the /aws/rds/cluster/auroralab-mysql-cluster/slowquery log group. Open the [Amazon Cloudwatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?p=clw&cp=bn&ad=c) console and select *Log groups* on the left hand side and search for auroralab-mysql-cluster/slowquery and it should see like below

<span class="image">![CWL](CWL_slow_query_1.png?raw=true)</span>

Under *Log streams*, pick your current *writer* node (since that is where we ran our script against) to view the slow query logs and you should see like below:

<span class="image">![CWL](CWL_slow_query_select.png?raw=true)</span>

*Note:* The default log retention period is *Never Expire* however this can be changed*. Please see* [Change log data retention in CloudWatch Logs] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/SettingLogRetention.html).

To increase the readability of these logs, we are going to use [Insights]((https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=eu-west-1#database:id=auroralab-mysql-cluster;is-cluster=true;tab=logs-and-events). Click on the *insights* and select your log group in the drop down list. For slow queries, it will be in the format of /aws/rds/cluster/auroralab-mysql-cluster/slowquery. In the text field, enter the following insights query by replacing the <writer node>

```shell
filter @logStream = 'auroralab-mysql-node-1'
| parse @message "# Time: * User@Host: * Id: * Query_time: * Lock_time: * Rows_sent: * Rows_examined: * timestamp=*;*" as Time, User, Id, Query_time,Lock_time,Rows_sent,Rows_examined,timestamp,Query
| display Time, Query_time, Query,Rows_sent,Rows_examined
| sort Query_time asc
```

This query parses the slow query logs and captures the individual fields like *Time, Query_time, Query,Rows_sent,Rows_examined*. Once entered and *Run query*, the output should look something like below.

<span class="image">![CWL](CWL_slow_query.png?raw=true)</span>

The queries listed are the offending queries which takes longer than the *long_query_time*. We could see around 100+ entries in the last 30 minutes.You can select any query to expand to find more information about it.

<span class="image">![CWL](CWL_slow_query_expand.png?raw=true)</span>

 You can also export the results to *csv* for easier analysis.For now let’s call it as *slow_query_log2*.


### Percona pt-query-digest

*One challenge is that it requires manual effort or some automation technique to find unique patterns/queries from the slow queries logs and it could be challenging with thousands of logs. In order to find the unique queries, there are several third party tools and one of them is percona’s pt-query-digest which is helpful to solve this problem.*

Disclaimer: Percona pt-query-digest is a third party software licensed under GNU so please use [official documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.0/pt-query-digest.html) for reference.

*pt-query-digest * is a open source tool from percona which analyzes MySQL queries from slow, general, and binary log files. You can learn more about this tool and download it from [here](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/installation.html).

In short, this tool summaries the top queries based on the input log file ranked by response time. This is a two step process.

*Step1:* First you need to download the *slow query logs* on the client. You can either do this over the *console* or *CLI*

#### Download using console

<span class="image">![PTQ](view_slow_logs.png?raw=true)</span>

*Note:* Log gets rotated hourly so please ensure the logs are downloaded for the workload period.

#### Download using cli

*CLI example*

```shell
aws rds download-db-log-file-portion --db-instance-identifier [writerendpoint] \
--starting-token 0 --output text --log-file-name slowquery/<slowlogname> > slow_log.txt
```

*Step2:*Once downloaded, you can run the pt-query-digest like below using the slow query log file we just downloaded.Please ensure the log name is correct.

```shell
$ pt-query-digest <slow_log_file.txt>
```

(1) This is a highly summarized view of the unique events in the detailed query report that follows. It contains the following columns and basically ranks the top offending queries and rank them from the slow query log which is easier to

```shell
Column        Meaning
============  ==========================================================
Rank          The query's rank within the entire set of queries analyzedQuery ID      The query's fingerprint
Response time The total response time, and percentage of overall total
Calls         The number of times this query was executed
R/Call        The mean response time per execution
V/M           The Variance-to-mean ratio of response time
Item          The distilled query
```

<span class="image">![PTQ](PTQ2.png?raw=true)</span>

For the queries listed above in the previous section, this section contains individual metrics about each query ID with stats like concurrency(calculated as a function of the timespan and total Query_time), exec time, rows sent, rows examine etc. This also provides the number of occurrences of a query in the log.

<span class="image">![PTQ](PTQ3.png?raw=true)</span>

If you are interested in learning what to do with the captured slow query logs, please proceed to the next lab [Aurora MySQL SQL Performance Troubleshooting - Analysis](/provisioned/sql_perf_analysis/)
