# Failback to Original Primary Region

As we have just done in the previous module, we can see that **Failover** is the process of shifting application and database resources from its original primary location to a secondary disaster recovery location during a large scale infrastructure or service level interruption. 

You may be able to design an application that is completely stateless and could be launched in any region, however the database tier, with Aurora Global Database, remain having one single Writer, and we have seen that it required promotion of the secondary DB cluster in order for it to begin serving write requests. Changes are now only tracked on the DB cluster in the secondary Region.

When the large scale interruption is restored, we usually want to restore the environment to its original setting, and synchronizing the original Primary Region to become the master node to serve write traffic. This process is called **Failback**, an operation that would see us returning production to its original location after the disaster event, while keeping track and capturing all the changed data that has been written to the recently promoted Secondary Region.

This is an *EXTRA CHALLENGE* module. You will only see high level instructions. Please take your time in first planning out the reverse/restore actions, and feel free to raise your hand (if you are at an AWS event) to share with us your thoughts and ideas!

## Restore Network Connections and Terminate the Simulated Failure

>  **`Region 1 (Primary)`**

* We were previously simulating a large scale regional/service level interruption by using a **Network ACL** that denies all network traffic. Go to your **VPC** Console and assign the subnets to use the original default NACLs.
