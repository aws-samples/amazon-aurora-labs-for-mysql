# Getting Started

## Create an AWS account
In order to complete the hands-on content on this site, you'll need an AWS Account. We strongly recommend that you use a personal account or create a new AWS account to ensure you have the necessary access and that you do not accidentally modify corporate resources. Do not use an AWS account from the company you work for unless they provide sandbox accounts just for this purpose.

If you are setting up an AWS account for the first time, follow the instructions below to [create an administrative IAM user account](#create-an-iam-user-with-admin-permissions), we recommend not using your AWS account root credentials for day to day usage. If you have received credits to complete these labs follow the instructions below on [adding the credits](#add-credits-optional) to your AWS account.

## Lab environment at a glance

To simplify the getting started experience with the labs, we have created foundational templates for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">AWS CloudFormation</a> that provision the resources needed for the lab environment. These templates are designed to deploy a consistent networking infrastructure, and client-side experience of software packages and components used in the lab.

<div class="architecture"><img src="/assets/images/generic-architecture.png"></div>

The environment deployed using CloudFormation includes several components:

*	<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html" target="_blank">Amazon VPC</a> network configuration with public and private subnets
*	<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.Subnets" target="_blank">Database subnet group</a> and relevant <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html" target="_blank">security groups</a> for the cluster and workstation
*	<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Instances.html" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 instance</a> configured with the software components needed for the lab
*	<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html" target="_blank">IAM roles</a> with access permissions for the workstation and cluster permissions for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html" target="_blank">enhanced monitoring</a>, S3 access and logging
*	Custom cluster and DB instance <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.html" target="_blank">parameter groups</a> for the Amazon Aurora cluster, enabling logging and performance schema
*	Optionally, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html" target="_blank">Amazon Aurora</a> DB cluster with 2 nodes: a writer and read replica
* If the cluster is created for you, the master database credentials will be generated automatically and stored in an <A href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html" target="_blank">AWS Secrets Manager</a> secret.
*	Optionally, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.html" target="_blank">read replica auto scaling</a> configuration
*	Optionally, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html" target="_blank">AWS Systems Manager</a> command document to execute a load test

## Create an IAM user (with admin permissions)
If you don't already have an AWS IAM user with admin permissions, please use the following instructions to create one:

6. Click **Dashboard** on the left navigation and use the **IAM users sign-in link** to login as the admin user you just created.


## Add credits (optional)
If you are doing these workshop as part of an AWS sponsored event that doesn't provide AWS accounts, you will receive credits to cover the costs. Below are the instructions for entering the credits:

1. Browse to the AWS Account Settings console.
2. Enter the Promo Code you received (these will be handed out at the beginning of the workshop).
