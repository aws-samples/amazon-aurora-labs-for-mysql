# DAT348 - Amazon Aurora Global Database in Action

![AWS re:Invent 2019](/assets/images/reinvent19-topbanner.png)

In this hands-on workshop, learn how to achieve multi-region resilience for your application backend by using **Amazon Aurora Global Database**. We focus on patterns for multi-region database rollout and real-world use cases. Get hands-on and learn how Aurora global database allows you to scale your infrastructure without having to implement complicated multi-region patterns and see how to best leverage Aurora global database for fast cross-region disaster recovery and low-latency global reads.

## Requirements
* AWS Account (Temporary accounts will be provided for AWS Events)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) web browser
* _PREFERRED:_ Familiarity with AWS [CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli), Management Console (EC2, RDS, VPC, CloudWatch), and basic SQL commands.

## Use the provided temporary AWS accounts

This workshop uses **AWS Event Engine**, a tool that dispenses individual workshop participants with a unique 12-digit alphanumeric code. This code should have been provided to you upon entry or beginning of the workshop, and it allows you to use a separate lab environment AWS account, without requiring the need for you to run this on your own personal or business accounts.

If you have not received the code, please reach out to one of our support staff at the workshop.

Go to <a href="https://dashboard.eventengine.run/" target="_blank">**https://dashboard.eventengine.run/**</a> (open a new browser tab), enter the access code and click **Proceed**.

On the **User Dashboard**, please click **AWS Console** to log into the AWS Management Console.

## Conventions

Due to the multi-region nature of this workshop, you will often be switching between the two regions that has been assigned to you. You can always confirm and change the region on the top of the AWS Console Navigation Menu. __Please be mindful__ that you are performing the actions in the proper region, as some of the resources created are very similar between the two regions. The instructions will clearly label the AWS Region in which you will be performing the actions in, as indicated by these unique header labels when switching:

> **`Region 1 (Primary)`**    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **`Region 2 (Secondary)`**

<span class="image">![Console Region Change](region-change.png)</span>

We will also provide commands for you to run in the terminal [(Systems Manager Session Manager)](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/#Session_Manager). These commands will look like this, with <b><i>highlighted text</i></b> usually replaced by values that are unique to your account settings and resource names:

<pre>
$ ssh -i <b><i>PRIVATE_KEY.PEM</i></b> ec2-user@<b><i>EC2_PUBLIC_DNS_NAME</i></b>
</pre>

You will often also see some sections that are expandable/collapsible to make the instructions more readable:
